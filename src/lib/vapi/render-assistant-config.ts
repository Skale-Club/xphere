// Pure renderer for a Vapi assistant's outbound configuration: system
// prompt, function/tool JSON-Schema parameters, and per-tool spoken messages.
//
// This module has zero imports of @supabase/* or fetch/network APIs — given
// the same input twice, it produces byte-identical output.
//
// It does NOT template tenant facts. That already happened once, at install
// time, into agent_prompt_versions (see src/lib/org-templates/prompt-template.ts):
// a business's name and address do not change between two phone calls, so
// freezing them into the stored prompt is correct.
//
// The service location block is the deliberate exception. `service_location_mode`
// is a live organization setting an operator can change in Settings at any
// moment, and Phase 138's locked decision is that no prompt may hardcode
// "ask" or "never ask" for a customer address — the engine renders it. The
// widget path does this in buildWorkflowTools(); this is the same rendering
// for the voice path, applied at push time so a mode change reaches the
// assistant on the next push rather than requiring a prompt edit. That is why
// `serviceLocationMode` is a required field: a caller cannot forget it and
// silently ship a prompt with no location rule at all.
//
// Function parameters are shaped from each workflow's own input_schema, so a
// future field there (e.g. Phase 138's customerAddress) reaches Vapi
// automatically with no change to this file.
//
// Per-tool spoken messages: an assistant that already carries tuned lines
// keeps them. This renderer has no way to know which tools are slow for an
// org it has never measured, and the generic fallback is deliberately bland
// ("One moment."), so overwriting an operator's tuned phrasing with it would
// be a regression every time. Existing messages are passed in by the caller
// (read off the live assistant immediately before the PATCH) and preserved
// verbatim; only a tool with no message of its own gets the fallback.
